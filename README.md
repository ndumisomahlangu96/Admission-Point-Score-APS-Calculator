# Admission-Point-Score-APS-Calculator
The Admission Point System (APS) is a, South African university entry mechanism that converts Grade 12 National Senior Certificate (NSC) percentages into a numerical score (1–7) per subject. By summing the points of six subjects (usually excluding Life Orientation), it provides a total score (max 42-49) to determine if a student meets the minimum academic requirements for specific courses.
How APS is Calculated
Point System: Points are awarded based on percentage ranges:
80%–100% = 7 points
70%–79% = 6 points
60%–69% = 5 points
50%–59% = 4 points
40%–49% = 3 points
30%–39% = 2 points
0%–29% = 1 point
Formula: Add the scores of your best six subjects (excluding Life Orientation).
